## DuskfallServer
DuskfallServer is an MMORPG server written from scratch based on Minestom APIs.

The server is fully data driven, loading custom items, enemies, and spawners from JSON files located in the server deployment folder.
The server also dynamically generates a resource pack for users, allowing for custom item textures, models, and GUIs all in vanilla Minecraft.
